Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is where the different variables of a class will not directly be accessible from other classes. These can only be accessed by using other methods within the class (e.g setters and getters).

Inheritance:
Inheritance is when a class is defined as a subclass of another class. It inherits the properties on the superclass.

Polymorphism:
It is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

Abstraction:
These are classes that contain an Abstract method.
These methods are defined in the abstract class without braces and cannot be instantiated.
Eg:
Public abstract class animals {
	// enter code
	Abstract void setNumberOfLegs();
}
These methods need to be defined in the subclasses.
